# alx minimum operations interview question

dynamic programming : 

    1. dividing the problem into subproblems
    2. store solution of subroblems to reuse them instead of recalculating
    3. build solution from solutions of subproblems

    storing data might happend by creating a dictionary for for each element :) 

    like fibbunaccic sequence , you can store fib(3) like {3:2}
    and before recalculating it u just check for its existance there.
